                *** Kant ***
Kant is a fast mdi-texteditor for the KDE destop.
It uses the KWrite Part and the normal kdelibs.
I hope it works well and improve workspeed on many little
textfiles. ;-)

             *** KNOWN ISSUES ***

1. Bookmarks are currently implemented in kwview, which means that setting a mark
   only affects the view in which it is set. Having a document displayed in more
   views this will seem unlogic.
