                *** Kate ***
Kate is a fast texteditor for the KDE destop with an Emacs-style document interface.
I hope it works well and improves workspeed on many little textfiles. ;-)
Our new buffer managment will allow it to open 50MB files ++ in less than 5 seconds
(at least on my 400Mhz P2 ;) It is thought as a more powerful replacement for the old
KWrite app, which will still keep alive for the existing userbase and because it is
just a lot smaller and therefor faster on launch than kate.

Other programs which want to use the kate part should use it through the common
KTextEditor interfaces in kdelibs or through the kate::view/document interfaces.
For Kate Plugins, Kate provides the Kate Interfaces, which allow deeper access
to the Kate app and its features.

                *** KWrite ***
The current KWrite app is based on the KWrite of kde 2.0 written by Jochen Wilhelmy
but now it uses the kate part (which is based on the old kwrite doc/view stuff
written by Jochen, too).
