                *** Kate version 0.2.1 ***
Kate is a fast texteditor for the KDE destop with an Emacs-style document interface.
I hope it works well and improve workspeed on many little
textfiles. ;-)

                *** KWrite ***
New KWrite app is using the Kate part ! ;-)


             *** KNOWN ISSUES ***

1. Bookmarks are currently implemented in kwview, which means that setting a mark
   only affects the view in which it is set. Having a document displayed in more
   views this will seem unlogic.

2. Some features are currently not finished. This includes project handling and
   plugin interface.

3. There is no documentation. Use the menus and read the kwrite manual for help.

4. You can not move focus away from the konsole using the keyboard, unless you hide
   it which will focus your current document.
