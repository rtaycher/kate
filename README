                *** Kate version 2.0 ***
Kate is a fast texteditor for the KDE destop with an Emacs-style document interface.
I hope it works well and improve workspeed on many little
textfiles. ;-)
Out new buffer managment will allow it to open 50MB files ++ in less than 5 seconds
(at least on my 400Mhz P2 ;)

Other programs which want to use the kate part should use it through the common
KTextEditor interfaces in kdelibs.
For Kate Plugins, Kate provides the Kate Interfaces, which allow deeper access
to the Kate app and its features.
