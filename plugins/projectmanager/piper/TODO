This is a class to sniff a stream of error messages

Todo: 

- let it use STL to store 
interesting strings, pop many strings instead of one

- let 'make test' from the top go down here to build &
 run the test.

- make all the other non-GUI systems testable like this

- Should we use <string> or QString here?

- Further abstract the error message detector to make detecting 
  errors from Python, Perl, assertions etc. easier. More snap-to-fit
  components & less Special Case code in the high-level functions...
