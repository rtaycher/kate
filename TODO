TODO:

For 3.0 and bugfix releases:
 - fix cursor pos stuff in the view, error checking must be done
 - we need a new slot/signal to restore the bookmarks/pos after the buffer is ready
 - search whole words
 - static word wrap
 - better indent/unindent
 - exhaustive testing of the new highlighting structure
 - porting all .xml files to the new scheme.
    Small help:
           A context of #pop returns to the next higher one (pop) (#pop#pop returns two steps and so on)
           A context of #stay stays in the current context (no more context="5" within context 5 (this
           is supported, but should be avoided in new definitions, because you run into problems when using
           #pop than. If a context >=0 is given as the argument a new entry is appended to the stack (push)

For 3.1 and later:
 - dynamic word wrap
 - code folding
 - code completion
 - blockwise paste must be done
 - more efficient hl buffer managment, I think of storing only the contexts in the buffer
