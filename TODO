TODO:
    - Tjeck docs for change on hd when focused, warning dialog: reload? yes/no[/view diff]

    - Find Text dialog needs ability to hit all documents.

    - context menu for file list [close, close all, new view top/btm/left/right, others?)
    - feature to open a clicked-on filename in the text

    - <Ctrl+Insert> should copy selected text (same as <Shift+Insert> currently pastes)
    - <Alt+Backspace> should undo
    - <Ctrl+Insert> on a blank line should copy the line to the clipboard
    - <Ctrl+U> should lowercase the next letter or a selection
    - <Shift+Ctrl+U> should uppercase the next letter or a selection

    - Plug-in to open the H file for a given C or CPP file or vice versa
      -  that's a plug-in because (shocked gasp) not everyone's a C++ programmer ;-)

    - <Shift+Left> should follow text, not go into virtual blank space
            KWrite uses "virtual blank space". When you click beyond where a
         programmer knows the \n is on a line, the text insertion caret
         appears under the mouse location. It is poised to insert enough
         spaces to hold text there if the user starts typing.
            The <Left> key flies over a \n into virtual space, instead of wrapping like
         on nearly all editors (except 'vi'). It's debatable whether the users "intent"
         is to roam out to a blank area and then type there, or to speed into the
            However, if the user moves <Shift+Left> over a \n, their only conceivable
         intent is to select words in the next line, and they should not have to use
         extra keystrokes, or (heaven forbid) grab the mouse, just to get there.

    - <Right> at the first column should wrap to the previous column. The user's
      "intent" is not to stare at the wall. Unlike 'vi', real editors understand
      that even casual users view characters as a string of beads, not as a rack
      of lines. Keystrokes that work within a line should also work across lines
      as if \n were just another bead. And editors should not /sometimes/ behave
      like text is a string of beads, but then /sometimes/ behave like it's a rack
      of lines

    - <Shift+Right> at the first column should wrap the selection end around to the prior line
        Fixing these issues will correct a minor display bug in the HTML Tag and
        Filter Text features. We could adjust those features to use deeper KWrite
        interfaces, but we should fix the bugs anyway

    - a Mode (for only the hardcore) in which <Left> and <Right> skip an entire word,
      and <Ctrl+Left> and <Ctrl+Right> skip only one character (reversing
      the standard keybindings). If we carefully tune the
      definition of a word, proficient users will use <Left> and <Right> far more often
      than <Alt+Left> and <Alt+Right>. The Amiga shareware editor UEdit's default
      key bindings did this. The definition of a word was a C language identifier. The
      definition of the end of a word was putting the caret between it and any spaces or
      punctuation that followed.  Word|. Doing it like that put the caret where you needed
      it most often.

    - [internal] fix how HTML Tag and Filter re-select your text if it is multi-line.
      As far as we could tell, KWrite exposed no interface to do this cleanly.

    - [internal] promote the things supporting both HTML Tag and Filter to a shared area
        so they don't dupe between two modules.
