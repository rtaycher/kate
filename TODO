TODO:
 - Check docs for change on hd when focused, warning dialog: reload? yes/no[/view diff]
 - Fix remaining bugs ;)
 - exhaustive testing of the new highlighting structure
 - porting all .xml files to the new scheme.
		Small help: 
		       A context of -1 returns to the next higher one (pop)
			     A context of -2 stays in the current context (no more context="5" within context 5 (this 
           is supported, but should be avoided in new definitions, because you run into problems when using
				   -1 than. If a context >=0 is given as the argument a new entry is appended to the stack (push)

	>>>>> IMPORTANT, instead of -1 and -2 you can now use #stay and #pop <<<<<<
