	* HTML button - select text, hit <Ctrl+Dash>, and enter the fields
	  for an SGML tag. Don't enter the < > or closing tag. We put these
	  around the selected text, and [try to] re-select that text so you can add
	  another nested tag right away. We are now the first HTML editor
	  that's actually better than Notepad! Hours of fun.

	* Filter - select text, hit <Ctrl+Backslash>, and enter an OS command.
	  we pipe the selected text thru that command, such as "sort", and then
	  replace the selection with the result. Impress your friends.
